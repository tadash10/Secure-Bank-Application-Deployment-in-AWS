An Elastic IP address is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is allocated to your AWS account, and is yours until you release it. By using an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account. Alternatively, you can specify the Elastic IP address in a DNS record for your domain, so that your domain points to your instance. For more information, see the documentation for your domain registrar.

An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address, which is reachable from the internet. If your instance does not have a public IPv4 address, you can associate an Elastic IP address with your instance to enable communication with the internet. For example, this allows you to connect to your instance from your local computer.

Elastic IP address basics

The following are the basic characteristics of an Elastic IP address:

    An Elastic IP address is static; it does not change over time.

    An Elastic IP address is for use in a specific Region only, and cannot be moved to a different Region.

    An Elastic IP address comes from Amazon's pool of IPv4 addresses, or from a custom IPv4 address pool that you have brought to your AWS account.

    To use an Elastic IP address, you first allocate one to your account, and then associate it with your instance or a network interface.

    When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance, it is also associated with the instance's primary network interface. When you associate an Elastic IP address with a network interface that is attached to an instance, it is also associated with the instance.

    When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance or its primary network interface, if the instance already has a public IPv4 address associated with it, that public IPv4 address is released back into Amazon's pool of public IPv4 addresses and the Elastic IP address is associated with the instance instead. You cannot reuse the public IPv4 address previously associated with the instance and you cannot convert that public IPv4 address to an Elastic IP address. For more information, see Public IPv4 addresses.

    You can disassociate an Elastic IP address from a resource, and then associate it with a different resource. To avoid unexpected behavior, ensure that all active connections to the resource named in the existing association are closed before you make the change. After you have associated your Elastic IP address to a different resource, you can reopen your connections to the newly associated resource.

    A disassociated Elastic IP address remains allocated to your account until you explicitly release it. You are charged for all Elastic IP addresses in your account, regardless of whether they are associated or disassociated with an instance. For more information, see the Public IPv4 Address tab on the Amazon VPC pricing

    page.

    When you associate an Elastic IP address with an instance that previously had a public IPv4 address, the public DNS host name of the instance changes to match the Elastic IP address.

    We resolve a public DNS host name to the public IPv4 address or the Elastic IP address of the instance outside the network of the instance, and to the private IPv4 address of the instance from within the network of the instance.

    When you allocate an Elastic IP address from an IP address pool that you have brought to your AWS account, it does not count toward your Elastic IP address limits. For more information, see Elastic IP address quota.

    When you allocate the Elastic IP addresses, you can associate the Elastic IP addresses with a network border group. This is the location from which we advertise the CIDR block. Setting the network border group limits the CIDR block to this group. If you do not specify the network border group, we set the border group containing all of the Availability Zones in the Region (for example, us-west-2).

    An Elastic IP address is for use in a specific network border group only.

Work with Elastic IP addresses

The following sections describe how you can work with Elastic IP addresses.

    Describe your Elastic IP addresses
    Tag an Elastic IP address
    Associate an Elastic IP address with an instance or network interface

Allocate an Elastic IP address

You can allocate an Elastic IP address from Amazon's pool of public IPv4 addresses, or from a custom IP address pool that you have brought to your AWS account. For more information about bringing your own IP address range to your AWS account, see Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in Amazon EC2.

You can allocate an Elastic IP address using one of the following methods.

To allocate an Elastic IP address

    Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

.

In the navigation pane, choose Network & Security, Elastic IPs.

Choose Allocate Elastic IP address.

(Optional) When you allocate an Elastic IP address (EIP), you choose the Network border group in which to allocate the EIP. A network border group is a collection of Availability Zones (AZs), Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones from which AWS advertises a public IP address. Local Zones and Wavelength Zones may have different network border groups than the AZs in a Region to ensure minimum latency or physical distance between the AWS network and the customers accessing the resources in these Zones.

    Important

    You must allocate an EIP in the same network border group as the AWS resource that will be associated with the EIP. An EIP in one network border group can only be advertised in zones in that network border group and not in any other zones represented by other network border groups.

    If you have Local Zones or Wavelength Zones enabled (for more information, see Enable a Local Zone or Enable Wavelength Zones), you can choose a network border group for AZs, Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones. Choose the network border group carefully as the EIP and the AWS resource it is associated with must reside in the same network border group. You can use the EC2 console to view the network border group that your Availability Zones, Local Zones, or Wavelength Zones are in. Typically, all Availability Zones in a Region belong to the same network border group, whereas Local Zones or Wavelength Zones belong to their own separate network border groups.

    If you don't have Local Zones or Wavelength Zones enabled, when you allocate an EIP, the network border group that represents all of the AZs for the Region (such as us-west-2) is predefined for you and you cannot change it. This means that the EIP that you allocate to this network border group will be advertised in all AZs in the Region you're in.

    For Public IPv4 address pool, choose one of the following:

        Amazon's pool of IPv4 addresses—If you want an IPv4 address to be allocated from Amazon's pool of IPv4 addresses.

        Public IPv4 address that you bring to your AWS account—If you want to allocate an IPv4 address from an IP address pool that you have brought to your AWS account. This option is disabled if you do not have any IP address pools.

        Customer owned pool of IPv4 addresses—If you want to allocate an IPv4 address from a pool created from your on-premises network for use with an AWS Outpost. This option is disabled if you do not have an AWS Outpost.

    (Optional) Add or remove a tag.

    [Add a tag] Choose Add new tag and do the following:

        For Key, enter the key name.

        For Value, enter the key value.

    [Remove a tag] Choose Remove to the right of the tag’s Key and Value.

    Choose Allocate.

Describe your Elastic IP addresses

You can describe an Elastic IP address using one of the following methods.

To describe your Elastic IP addresses

    Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

    .

    In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.

    Select the Elastic IP address to view and choose Actions, View details.

Tag an Elastic IP address

You can assign custom tags to your Elastic IP addresses to categorize them in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. This helps you to quickly find a specific Elastic IP address based on the custom tags that you assigned to it.

Cost allocation tracking using Elastic IP address tags is not supported.

You can tag an Elastic IP address using one of the following methods.

To tag an Elastic IP address

    Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

    .

    In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.

    Select the Elastic IP address to tag and choose Actions, View details.

    In the Tags section, choose Manage tags.

    Specify a tag key and value pair.

    (Optional) Choose Add tag to add additional tags.

    Choose Save.

Associate an Elastic IP address with an instance or network interface

If you're associating an Elastic IP address with your instance to enable communication with the internet, you must also ensure that your instance is in a public subnet. For more information, see Internet gateways in the Amazon VPC User Guide.

You can associate an Elastic IP address with an instance or network interface using one of the following methods.

To associate an Elastic IP address with an instance

    Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

    .

    In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.

    Select the Elastic IP address to associate and choose Actions, Associate Elastic IP address.

    For Resource type, choose Instance.

    For instance, choose the instance with which to associate the Elastic IP address. You can also enter text to search for a specific instance.

    (Optional) For Private IP address, specify a private IP address with which to associate the Elastic IP address.

    Choose Associate.

To associate an Elastic IP address with a network interface

    Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

    .

    In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.

    Select the Elastic IP address to associate and choose Actions, Associate Elastic IP address.

    For Resource type, choose Network interface.

    For Network interface, choose the network interface with which to associate the Elastic IP address. You can also enter text to search for a specific network interface.

    (Optional) For Private IP address, specify a private IP address with which to associate the Elastic IP address.

    Choose Associate.

Disassociate an Elastic IP address

You can disassociate an Elastic IP address from an instance or network interface at any time. After you disassociate the Elastic IP address, you can reassociate it with another resource.

You can disassociate an Elastic IP address using one of the following methods.

To disassociate and reassociate an Elastic IP address

    Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

    .

    In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.

    Select the Elastic IP address to disassociate, choose Actions, Disassociate Elastic IP address.

    Choose Disassociate.

Transfer Elastic IP addresses

This section describes how to transfer Elastic IP addresses from one AWS account to another. Transferring Elastic IP addresses can be helpful in the following situations:

    Organizational restructuring – Use Elastic IP address transfers to quickly move workloads from one AWS account to another. You don't have to wait for new Elastic IP addresses to be allowlisted in your security groups and NACLs.

    Centralized security administration – Use a centralized AWS security account to track and transfer Elastic IP addresses that have been vetted for security compliance.

    Disaster recovery – Use Elastic IP address transfers to quickly remap IPs for public-facing internet workloads during emergency events.

There is no charge for transferring Elastic IP addresses.
Tasks

    Enable Elastic IP address transfer
    Disable Elastic IP address transfer
    Accept a transferred Elastic IP address

Enable Elastic IP address transfer

This section describes how to accept a transferred Elastic IP address. Note the following limitations related to enabling Elastic IP addresses for transfer:

    You can transfer Elastic IP addresses from any AWS account (source account) to any other AWS account in the same AWS Region (transfer account).

    When you transfer an Elastic IP address, there is a two-step handshake between the AWS accounts. When the source account starts the transfer, the transfer accounts have seven days to accept the Elastic IP address transfer. During those seven days, the source account can view the pending transfer (for example in the AWS console or by using the describe-address-transfers AWS CLI command). After seven days, the transfer expires and ownership of the Elastic IP address returns to the source account.

    Accepted transfers are visible to the source account (for example in the AWS console or by using the describe-address-transfers AWS CLI command) for three days after the transfers have been accepted.

    AWS does not notify transfer accounts about pending Elastic IP address transfer requests. The owner of the source account must notify the owner of the transfer account that there is an Elastic IP address transfer request that they must accept.

    Any tags that are associated with an Elastic IP address being transferred are reset when the transfer is complete.

    You cannot transfer Elastic IP addresses allocated from public IPv4 address pools that you bring to your AWS account – commonly referred to as Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) address pools.

    If you attempt to transfer an Elastic IP address that has a reverse DNS record associated with it, you can begin the transfer process, but the transfer account will not be able to accept the transfer until the associated DNS record is removed.

    If you have enabled and configured AWS Outposts, you might have allocated Elastic IP addresses from a customer-owned IP address pool (CoIP). You cannot transfer Elastic IP addresses allocated from a CoIP. However, you can use AWS RAM to share a CoIP with another account. For more information, see Customer-owned IP addresses in the AWS Outposts User Guide.

    You can use Amazon VPC IPAM to track the transfer of Elastic IP addresses to accounts in an organization from AWS Organizations. For more information, see View IP address history. If an Elastic IP address is transferred to an AWS account outside of the organization, the IPAM audit history of the Elastic IP address is lost.

These steps must be completed by the source account.

To enable Elastic IP address transfer

    Ensure that you're using the source AWS account.

    Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

    .

    In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.

    Select one or more Elastic IP address to enable for transfer and choose Actions, Enable transfer.

    If you are transferring multiple Elastic IP addresses, you’ll see the Transfer type option. Choose one of the following options:

        Choose Single account if you are transferring the Elastic IP addresses to a single AWS account.

        Choose Multiple accounts if you are transferring the Elastic IP addresses to multiple AWS accounts.

    Under Transfer account ID, enter the IDs of the AWS accounts that you want to transfer the Elastic IP addresses to.

    Confirm the transfer by entering enable in the text box.

    Choose Submit.

    To accept the transfer, see Accept a transferred Elastic IP address. To disable the transfer, see Disable Elastic IP address transfer.

Disable Elastic IP address transfer

This section describes how to disable an Elastic IP transfer after the transfer has been enabled.

These steps must be completed by the source account that enabled the transfer.

To disable an Elastic IP address transfer

    Ensure that you're using the source AWS account.

    Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

    .

    In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.

    In the resource list of Elastic IPs, ensure that you have the property enabled that shows the column Transfer status.

    Select one or more Elastic IP address that have a Transfer status of Pending, and choose Actions, Disable transfer.

    Confirm by entering disable in the text box.

    Choose Submit.

Accept a transferred Elastic IP address

This section describes how to accept a transferred Elastic IP address.

When you transfer an Elastic IP address, there is a two-step handshake between the AWS accounts. When the source account starts the transfer, the transfer accounts have seven days to accept the Elastic IP address transfer. During those seven days, the source account can view the pending transfer (for example in the AWS console or by using the describe-address-transfers AWS CLI command). After seven days, the transfer expires and ownership of the Elastic IP address returns to the source account.

When accepting transfers, note the following exceptions that might occur and how to resolve them:

    AddressLimitExceeded: If your transfer account has exceeded the Elastic IP address quota, the source account can enable Elastic IP address transfer, but this exception occurs when the transfer account tries to accept the transfer. By default, all AWS accounts are limited to 5 Elastic IP addresses per Region. See Elastic IP address quota for instructions on increasing the limit.

    InvalidTransfer.AddressCustomPtrSet: If you or someone in your organization has configured the Elastic IP address that you are attempting to transfer to use reverse DNS lookup, the source account can enable transfer for the Elastic IP address, but this exception occurs when the transfer account tries to accept the transfer. To resolve this issue, the source account must remove the DNS record for the Elastic IP address. For more information, see Use reverse DNS for email applications.

    InvalidTransfer.AddressAssociated: If an Elastic IP address is associated with an ENI or EC2 instance, the source account can enable transfer for the Elastic IP address, but this exception occurs when the transfer account tries to accept the transfer. To resolve this issue, the source account must disassociate the Elastic IP address. For more information, see Disassociate an Elastic IP address.

For any other exceptions, contact AWS Support

.

These steps must be completed by the transfer account.

To accept an Elastic IP address transfer

    Ensure that you're using the transfer account.

    Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

    .

    In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.

    Choose Actions, Accept transfer.

    No tags that are associated with the Elastic IP address being transferred are transferred with the Elastic IP address when you accept the transfer. If you want to define a Name tag for the Elastic IP address that you are accepting, select Create a tag with a key of 'Name' and a value that you specify.

    Enter the Elastic IP address that you want to transfer.

    If you are accepting multiple transferred Elastic IP addresses, choose Add address to enter an additional Elastic IP address.

    Choose Submit.

Release an Elastic IP address

If you no longer need an Elastic IP address, we recommend that you release it using one of the following methods. The address to release must not be currently associated with an AWS resource, such as an EC2 instance, NAT gateway, or Network Load Balancer.
Note

If you contacted AWS support to set up reverse DNS for an Elastic IP (EIP) address, you can remove the reverse DNS, but you can’t release the Elastic IP address because it’s been locked by AWS support. To unlock the Elastic IP address, contact AWS Support

. After the Elastic IP address is unlocked, you can release the Elastic IP address.

To release an Elastic IP address

    Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

    .

    In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.

    Select the Elastic IP address to release and choose Actions, Release Elastic IP addresses.

    Choose Release.

Recover an Elastic IP address

If you have released your Elastic IP address, you might be able to recover it. The following rules apply:

    You cannot recover an Elastic IP address if it has been allocated to another AWS account, or if it will result in your exceeding your Elastic IP address limit.

    You cannot recover tags associated with an Elastic IP address.

    You can recover an Elastic IP address using the Amazon EC2 API or a command line tool only.

To recover an Elastic IP address

Use the allocate-address AWS CLI command and specify the IP address using the --address parameter as follows.

aws ec2 allocate-address --domain vpc --address 203.0.113.3

Use reverse DNS for email applications

If you intend to send email to third parties from an instance, we recommend that you provision one or more Elastic IP addresses and assign static reverse DNS records to the Elastic IP addresses that you use to send email. This can help you avoid having your email flagged as spam by some anti-spam organizations. AWS works with ISPs and internet anti-spam organizations to reduce the chance that your email sent from these addresses will be flagged as spam.
Considerations

    Before you create a reverse DNS record, you must set a corresponding forward DNS record (record type A) that points to your Elastic IP address.

    If a reverse DNS record is associated with an Elastic IP address, the Elastic IP address is locked to your account and cannot be released from your account until the record is removed.
    AWS GovCloud (US) Region

    You can't create a reverse DNS record using the console or AWS CLI. AWS must assign the static reverse DNS records for you. Open Request to remove reverse DNS and email sending limitations

    and provide us with your Elastic IP addresses and reverse DNS records.

Create a reverse DNS record

To create a reverse DNS record, choose the tab that matches your preferred method.

    Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

    .

    In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.

    Select the Elastic IP address and choose Actions, Update reverse DNS.

    For Reverse DNS domain name, enter the domain name.

    Enter update to confirm.

    Choose Update.

Remove a reverse DNS record

To remove a reverse DNS record, choose the tab that matches your preferred method.

    Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

    .

    In the navigation pane, choose Elastic IPs.

    Select the Elastic IP address and choose Actions, Update reverse DNS.

    For Reverse DNS domain name, clear the domain name.

    Enter update to confirm.

    Choose Update.

Elastic IP address quota

By default, all AWS accounts have a quota of five (5) Elastic IP addresses per Region, because public (IPv4) internet addresses are a scarce public resource. We strongly encourage you to use an Elastic IP address primarily for the ability to remap the address to another instance in the case of instance failure, and to use DNS hostnames for all other inter-node communication.
To verify how many Elastic IP addresses are in use

Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/

and choose Elastic IPs from the navigation pane.
To verify your current account quota for Elastic IP addresses

    Open the Service Quotas console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/

    .

    From the navigation bar (at the top of the screen), select a Region.

    On the Dashboard, choose Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).

    If Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is not listed on the Dashboard, choose AWS services, enter EC2 in the search field, and then choose Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).

    On the Amazon EC2 service quotas page, enter IP in the search field. The limit is EC2-VPC Elastic IPs. For more information, choose the limit.

If you think your architecture warrants additional Elastic IP addresses, you can request a quota increase directly from the Service Quotas console. To request a quota increase, choose Request increase at account-level. For more information, see Amazon EC2 service quotas.
